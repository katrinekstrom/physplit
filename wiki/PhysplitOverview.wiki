#summary Overview of the code structure.

= Introduction =

So... Maybe this page will help me get the code in order before I upload the inaugural version, which I plan to do before packing up today and going home. Ultimately this page will serve as a root to all general descriptions code.

Broadly speaking, the code can be categorised into five major sections. The following  modules are being developed to handle:

* *physplit.conf*: Specification of problem (model domain, data sources, pollutant characteristics etc.)
* *physplit.exec*: I/O to the hysplit numerical crunching machine
* *physplit.arch*: Output data archiving
* *pyhsplit.plot*: Plotting and presentation of results
* *physplit.diag*: Diagnostic tools
